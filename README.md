# Computational_Physics
- Week 1: created scripts to evaluate series expansion, interpolation of functions and gradient descent
- Week 2: created scripts to calculate first order derivatives, second order derivates, w/ their errors, looking also at the richardson methods which has a high efficiency
- Week 3: created scripts to calculate integrals (trapezoidal / Simpson), their errors and some physics examples
- Week 4:
